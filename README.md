# PCP-Python
Purwadhika Capstone Project for Python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Python program made to fulfill the requirements from Purwadhika.
In short, the program are based on real world cases such as warehouse program, student grade data, sales data, etc.
My program is an warehouse stocklist program for a fictional audio store called JR's Audio.

Known issues:
1. The format of displayed data can be broken with too long names or brand
2. Search term is case sensitive, could be improved with Regex
3. Overall menu can be made more readable by using match switch (requires python 3.10)

Changelog

2. 2023-05-14: Added error message upon selecting numbers greater than numbers on menu selection
